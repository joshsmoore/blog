Well, I have been bouncing around trying to figure out what blogging system I wanted to use to host Coding For Rent.  In the end I ended up with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  I mostly choose Jekyll because it is dead simple to use and allows me the flexibility to do what I want.  But, most importantly it allows me to edit the posts in which ever way I want.
